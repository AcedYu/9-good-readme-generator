# 9-good-readme-generator
This assignment was assigned by the U.C. Berkeley Extension Full-time Full Stack Flex Boot Camp.
This is assignment 9 for the program. In this assignment I created a command line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the [Inquirer package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer).

It contains notable features such as:
- high quality README generation based on user input
- user input prompts for
 - title
 - description
 - installation instructions
 - usage information
 - contribution guidelines
 - test instructions
 - Github Username
 - User Email
- user selected choices for license which includes
 - the license badge
 - an explanation for which license the application is covered under
- A clickable table of contents which lead the user to its corresponding section
